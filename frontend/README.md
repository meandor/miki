# Frontend
A react and typescript single page application bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Installing dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

## Tests and checks
To run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```

### Auto-formatting
```bash
npm run format
```

### Linting
```bash
npm run lint
```

## Run locally
```bash
npm start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Build production version
```bash
npm build
```
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed! You can use this for example to build a docker container.
